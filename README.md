# FourCardFeature
A Frontend Mentor Challenge.
My GitHub was not linked to Frontend Mentor at the time I created this which is why the images and
fonts are not exact. Frontend mentor gives you a number of files which includes font/image info
when you link your GitHub account to the website and select start challenge on their site.
I was more focused on recreating the structure/look as well as the web/mobile responsiveness 
as much as possible without worrying too much about the exact images and fonts.
